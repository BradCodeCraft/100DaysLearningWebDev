                          Nikola Tesla is perhaps one of the greatest scientists and American inventors that have ever lived. His experiments were far beyond his time, which left much of his work underappreciated until after he passed away. Born on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1856, in Austria, where he would then make his way to New York City to further his work.

                          He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.

                          Some of Nikola Tesla's biggest achievements include, but are not limited to, alternating current, first hydro-electric power plant, x-rays, tesla's induction motor, measurement of flux density, wireless transmission.

                          Unfortunately, he passed away on January 7<sup>th</sup> of 1943. Without him, the physics world that we know today would not have come to fruition.
